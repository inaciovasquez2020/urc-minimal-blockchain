# URC Minimal Blockchain
**A Reference Implementation for Distributed Capacity Retention**

---

###  Institutional Verification
* **Registry ID:** `ART-BC-01`
* **Verification Status:** [Verified via URF-Dashboard](https://inaciovasquez2020.github.io/vasquez-index/dashboard.html)
* **Framework Alignment:** Unified Rigidity Framework (URF) — Law 3 & 4

---

## Overview
This is a reference Nakamoto consensus implementation designed to demonstrate **Structural Rigidity** in distributed information systems. It satisfies the core URF requirement of deterministic capacity retention under finite-model constraints.

### Core Features
* **Minimal Complexity:** < 400 LOC for maximum auditability.
* **Deterministic Consensus:** Resolves the state-transition operator without external dependencies.
* **URF Integration:** Specifically engineered to avoid the *Expander Obstruction* in peer-to-peer topology.

## Rigidity Context
In the context of the **Unified Rigidity Framework**, this blockchain serves as an applied witness of:
$$\inf \mathrm{Spec}(\Delta_H \mid \ker(\mathrm{Per})^\perp) > 0$$

Where the "Spectral Gap" is represented by the deterministic finality of the block sequence under the logic-width constraint $k \ge f(tw)$.

## Verification
